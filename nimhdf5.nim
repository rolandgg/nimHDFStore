# NOTE:
# a short note on naming convention:
# The idea originally was to use snake_case for all procedures, which
# are usable for users of this library, while using camelCase for
# all internal (although sometimes exported `*` procedures) procedures.
# At the moment however, unfortunately this is not quite the case.
# (see TODO below)

# simple list of TODOs
# TODO:
#  - CHECK: does opening an dataset in a file, and trying to write a larger
#    dataset to it than the one currently in the file work? Does not seem to
#    be the case, but I didn't t see any errors either?!
#  - add iterators for attributes, groups etc..!
#  - add `contains` proc to check for elements in file / group (-> in, notin)
#  - add proc to delete dataset or group (this is especially needed for the case
#    in which we wish to rewrite a fixed size dataset with a different size!
#  - add ability to write arraymancer.Tensor (properly)
#  - add a lot of safety checks
#  - fix up naming convention of procs.
#    either default to:
#    - internal procs camelCase, external snake_case
#      external use of snake_case would reflect usage of HDF5 C API as well as h5py
#    or simply switch everything to either camelCase or snake_case. In this case
#    snake_case seems the reasonable choice to keep similar API calls as h5py
#  - CLEAN UP and refactor the code! way too long in a single file by now...
